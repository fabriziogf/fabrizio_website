I am also an endurance sports enthusiast. I began rowing when I was 14 years old at the Club Athletico Paulistano (Sao Paulo, Brazil). I then came to the United States for the last two years of high school and then college, being part of the Groton School rowing and the Princeton lightweight rowing teams. After graduation, I followed my fathers' footsteps and decided to delve into triathlon.
