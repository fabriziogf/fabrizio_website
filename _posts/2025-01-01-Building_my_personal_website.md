## Why build a personal website?
The purpose of this website is to not only showcase some of my technical skills, but also to serve as motivation to write and code more often. In spite of having a demand job as a Product Manager, I want to explore topics that I am personally curious about (although sometimes they are related to my profession).

I also used VS Code as a way to explore the new Copilot feature that has been so hyped.

## Building a Github website using Jekyll

Some of the changes that I made:
1. Configured author
2. Added links to relevant social media accounts
3. Added resume link
4. Added content in resume summary
5. Changed font size and general small formatting things

I decided to use the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/
I liked this particulatr theme (one of many) because of the simple style of the website and the great documentation that the author has put together.

You can explore the repo yourself: 


## Adding my resume info

I also wanted to make my resume fun and showcase my interests. One cool feature I wanted to add was a Strava widget. I sepnd way too much time biking, running, and swiming.

## Writing this first post

Even writing this post was a great way to learn more about the structure of the Jekyll repository and the configuration of posts.
1. Writing this post, also had to make sure that the YAML Front Matter is correct
2. Part of the config file is also to recommend similar posts
